## Requirements
* Node.js 12.10.0 +
* FFmpeg

## Setup:
* npm install
* create a .env file for a discord authentication token
* create a new Discord application and bot
* configure from config.json and eloConfig.json
* add countdown audio file to root folder or remove audio playback from startRace.js
* ELO uses a json storage file. Good enough for small servers, but I would replace it with MongoDB or another db server for a large population. Data handling is abstracted in ../data/data.js for easy swapping.

## TODO
* Spam prevention

### changelog
